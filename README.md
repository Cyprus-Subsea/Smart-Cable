# Smart-Cable
Smart Cable is a cable assembly with a modular pressure tolerant electronics circuit embedded inline which can take care of any sensor integration need such as voltage regulation, protocol translation, data processing, storage and many more which traditionally often requires many months of engineering effort. The circuit consists of a base plate with the right connections to connect any variation of modules. the modules consist of processor module, protocol modules (RS-323, 485, 422, Ethernet, USB, CAN-bus) , power module and a variety of miscellaneous modules (ADC, memory, Real-time clock, etc.)
